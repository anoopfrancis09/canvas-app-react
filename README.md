# Canvas App

This is a simple React application to upload and import images to canvas. This application also allows user to position the image inside canvas. Once they are ok with the positioning they can upload the image to a JSON file and reuse it on a later time.

## System requirements

In order to build the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In the root of this repository, you can resolve all these dependencies via
the command line using:

    npm install

You can now start developing the application using Webpack by typing:

    npm start

Now, the application would have started on your default browser.
